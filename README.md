# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheFossilDev
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating free apps and software services that help people.
## What I'm working on:
- **PacDude** Teaching a neural net how to play pacman
- **Craftmatica** A free website that hosts minecraft schematics and features a 3d rendered preview and built-in material list
- **CodeConnect** A course project website focusing on connecting open source developers, computer science students, and anyone working on portfolio projects
- **Statify** An all-in-one spotify stats viewer that combines tools like receiptify and yearly wrapped
